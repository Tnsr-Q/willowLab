# Willow Lab Talking Points, References, and Miscellany

## Source references cited in the PDFs
- Robust validation playbook references (`Robust validation.pdf`) anchor the Step-1 Trinity invariants design.【F:Willow lab setup.txt†L69-L72】
- Group-theory dossiers (`Group 1.pdf` and `Group 2.pdf`) back the Spectral↔Entanglement, η-lock, and topology synthesis batteries.【F:Willow lab setup.txt†L100-L126】

## Presentation-ready highlights
- Lead with the unified pitch: normalize every dataset into the Willow schema, push it through the Trinity analyzer for cancellation-safe resolvent features and EP diagnostics, then run the Spectral, η-lock, and Wilson/residue batteries to ship reproducible topology reports from one API.【F:Willow lab setup.txt†L205-L244】
- Showcase the production-grade invariants, residue atlas, non-Abelian Wilson loops, and c₁₄ estimator as provenance glints the team can point to during talks.【F:Willow lab ext 1.txt†L1533-L1568】
- Close with the scaling playbook for parameter cartography—truncate to top residues, use FFT-Poisson solves for p=2 grids, or tile with halos—to reassure stakeholders about throughput on large scans.【F:Willow lab ext 1.txt†L1570-L1628】

## Usage reminders and follow-ups
- Minimal code snippet: load a Willow NPZ, run `WillowTrinityStep1.compute_all()`, and attach Spectral duality checks when entropy and energy data are present for quick reporting.【F:Willow lab setup.txt†L1914-L1956】
- Offer to mint an example NPZ from prior Floquet runs, execute all three batteries, and iterate thresholds against the hardware noise floor before expanding into full cartography scans.【F:Willow lab setup.txt†L1957-L2005】
